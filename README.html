        <h1 id="jquery-multi-select-crossover">jQuery Multi-Select Crossover</h1>
<p>This is a demo for a simple multi-select widget built on jQuery. I built this to fulfill requirements for a form and continue to lean on it. It&#39;s a pretty straight-forward and practical widget.</p>
<h2 id="use">Use</h2>
<p>The widget was designed for use with forms. The first select box is populated using array data. The buttons simply move options between the two select boxes. I&#39;ve also added a text input for users to manually add entries.</p>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>At this point, I have not designed the widget for use on mobile platforms. It works but the look and feel are not elegant to say the least. I expect to update this in the future.</p>
