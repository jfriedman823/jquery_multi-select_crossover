<p>This is a demo for a simple multi-select widget built on jQuery. I built this to fulfill requirements for a form and continue to lean on it. It&#39;s a pretty straight-forward and practical widget.</p>

<h2 id="use">Use</h2>
<p>The widget was designed for use with forms. The first select box is populated using array data. The buttons simply move options between the two select boxes. I&#39;ve also added a text input for users to manually add entries.</p>
<h2 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h2>
<p>All you need is a link to jQuery. I&#39;m using jQuery v3.4.1. 
You can download jQuery here: <a href="https://jquery.com/">https://jquery.com/</a></p>
<p>I&#39;m also using bootstrap, but any css framework will work.</p>
<h2 id="validation">Validation</h2>
<p>The widget is compatible with form validation libraries. I&#39;ve used it with both jQuery Validator and Kendo UI validation.</p>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>At this point, I have not designed the widget for use on mobile platforms. It works but the look and feel are not elegant to say the least. I expect to update this in the future.</p>
