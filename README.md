# jQuery Multi-Select Crossover
This is a demo for a simple multi-select widget built on jQuery. I built this to fulfill requirements for a form and continue to lean on it. It's a pretty straight-forward and practical widget.

## Use
The widget was designed for use with forms. The first select box is populated using array data. The buttons simply move options between the two select boxes. I've also added a text input for users to manually add entries.

## Validation
The widget is compatible with form validation libraries. I've used it with both jQuery Validator and Kendo UI validation.

## Limitations
At this point, I have not designed the widget for use on mobile platforms. It works but the look and feel are not elegant to say the least. I expect to update this in the future.
