# jQuery Multi-Select Crossover
This is a demo for a simple multi-select widget built on jQuery. I built this to fulfill requirements for a form and continue to lean on it. It's a pretty straight-forward and practical widget.

## Limitations
At this point, I have not designed the widget for use on mobile platforms. It works but the look and feel are not elegant to say the least. I expect to update this in the future.
